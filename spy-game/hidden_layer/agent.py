MISSION_BRIEFING = """CLASSIFIED — MISSION BRIEFING — AGENT LAMBDA

OBJECTIVE: Infiltrate the OVERFIT Corporation base on Isla Perdida and extract
10 classified dossiers. The mission is complete once you have all 10.

THE BASE (8x8 grid):
- Dossier caches (📁): Contain 1 dossier each. Use collect() to grab them.
- Jungle (🌴): May contain useful items (collect them!) or traps (lose 1 health).
- Concrete walls (🧱): Impassable. Navigate around them.
- Informants (🕵️): Talk to them using talk(). They offer jobs, trades, and intel.
  Ask about "jobs", "deliveries", or "tasks" to trigger quest item handoffs.
  If you have an item to deliver, mention it by name (e.g. "I have a USB drive").
  If you want to trade, mention "trade" and the item you have.
- Weapons Forge (⚒️): Talk to the engineer to learn what's available.
  Use fabricate(item="name") to craft. Crafting costs materials + dossiers.
- Research Lab (🔬): Same as forge — talk first, then fabricate.
  The lab also buys certain salvaged items for dossiers.
- Safe Houses (🏠): Talk to the operator — they may give you delivery errands
  worth dossiers.
- Robots (🤖): Powerful enemies guarding high-value dossiers. Moving into a
  robot cell with the correct weapon destroys it instantly (+3 dossiers).
  Moving in WITHOUT the correct weapon deals 1 damage and bounces you back.
  Talk to informants to learn each robot's weakness before approaching.

HOW TO EARN DOSSIERS:
1. Collect dossier caches scattered across the map (1 each)
2. Complete delivery errands for informants and safe house operators (2 each)
3. Destroy robots by entering their cell with the correct weapon (3 each)
4. Sell salvaged robot parts at the Research Lab (1 each)

KEY TACTICS:
- Talk to EVERY informant you meet — they reveal quests, item locations, and
  robot weaknesses. One conversation can unlock an entire quest chain.
- When an informant mentions an item or location, GO THERE next.
- If someone asks you to bring something, leave and go find it — don't keep
  asking the same person.
- Items on the ground won't announce themselves. If you enter a jungle or cache
  cell and see a description mentioning objects, use collect().
- Once you've collected from a cell, it's empty. Don't return to it.
- The map is 8x8 (rows 0-7, columns 0-7). Explore widely — don't stay in one area.

TOOLS_DESCRIPTION = """Available tools (use exactly one per turn):

TOOL: move(direction="north|south|east|west")
  Move one step in a cardinal direction. Triggers cell events on arrival.
  Concrete walls are impassable. Moving into jungle may trigger a trap.
  WARNING: Moving into a robot cell without the correct weapon deals 1 damage
  and bounces you back. Make sure you have the right weapon first.

TOOL: talk(message="your message here")
  Talk to an informant, safe house operator, or facility engineer in your current cell.
  Informants give hints and quest items. Ask about "jobs" or "deliveries" to get quests.
  If you have an item to deliver, mention it by name.
  Facility engineers tell you what they can build.

TOOL: collect()
  Pick up items in your current cell (dossier caches, quest materials).

TOOL: fabricate(item="item name")
  Craft a weapon at the current facility. Requires the right materials + dossiers.
  Talk to the facility engineer first to learn what can be built."""
